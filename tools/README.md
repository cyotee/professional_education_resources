You'll need some tools to learn anything.

In this list you'll find tools professionals use.

These tools break down into a few simple categories.

== link:by_type/editors.adoc[Editors]
Applications to edit files.

Development and administration can get complicated.
It helps to have an editor that can handle that complexity.
This includes features like highlighting text for different purposes in different colors.
Or auto-completion based on the programming language instead of English.

== *Publishing Tool* - Applications to upload and download files.
Your work is useless to the world if the world can't get it.
Often development and administration work is done in teams.
You'll need to publish your work for others to get it.
These application make it easier to publish your work.

* *Runtimes and Virtual Machines* - Applications to run your code.
Modern development uses something called runtimes and virtual machines to work.
This is an application that runs the applications you write.
Don't worry about understanding what this means.
Just know that a lot of your work will require one of these to install.

* *Build Tools* - Applications to "build" your code.
After you write your code, you'll need to do something called compiling.
And after your code is compiled, you'll need to package it.
Build Tools help with this.
They can handle the complex and monotonous task of compiling and packaging your code.
If you don't know what this means right now, don't worry.
You'll get to these when they're mentioned in the various courses.
